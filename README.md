Mutex Watershed
===============

The Mutex Watershed algorithm for efficient segmentation without seeds.

Installation
------------

**On Unix (Linux, OS X)**
 - create conda env with xtensor:
 - `conda create -n mws -c conda-forge xtensor-python`
 - activate the env:
 - `source activate mws`
 - clone this repository, enter it and install:
 - `python setup.py install`



ISBI Experiments
----------------

To reproduce the ISBI experiments, go to the `experiments/isbi` folder
and run the `isbi_experiments` script:
`python isbi_experiments.py /path/to/raw.h5 /path/to/affinities.h5 /path/to/res_folder --algorithms mws`

You will need vigra as additional dependency:
`conda install -c conda-forge vigra`

You can also reproduce the baseline results by specifying further algorithms.
Note that most of these will need the https://github.com/constantinpape/cremi_tools
repository and further dependencies specified there.

You can obtain the data from:
https://hcicloud.iwr.uni-heidelberg.de/index.php/s/6LuE7nxBN3EFRtL



Training affinity networks
--------------------------

To train an affinity network for isbi, you can use the scripts in `experiments/training`.
You will also need [inferno](https://github.com/inferno-pytorch/inferno) and [neurofire](https://github.com/inferno-pytorch/neurofire)



Patch Experiments
---------------------
To compute the mutex watershed segmentation on the patch predictions, go to the `experiments/patch` folder
and run the `experiment` script:
`python experiment.py /path/to/affinities.hdf key-in-hdf-file /path/to/res_folder`
